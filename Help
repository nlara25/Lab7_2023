I should have asked about this during class over the past few days because I believed I could solve it independently. 
Having said that, no matter what I tried, I couldn't understand why it consistently focuses on the last eighth of the .txt file. 
Although this part is correct, it appears to neglect everything else in the order. 
I'm curious why my code only retrieves information from the final eighth of the .txt file, as I really want to come back to this project on a later date.
